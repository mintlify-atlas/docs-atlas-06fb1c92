# whatsapp-rust

A high-performance, async Rust library for the WhatsApp Web API. Inspired by [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow) (Go) and [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) (TypeScript).

<Note>
  This is an unofficial, open-source reimplementation. Using custom WhatsApp clients may violate Meta's Terms of Service and could result in account suspension. Use at your own risk.
</Note>

## Key features

### Authentication

- **Pair code linking** - Link using phone number with 8-digit code
- **Persistent sessions** - Automatic reconnection with session management

### Messaging

- **End-to-end encryption** - Full Signal Protocol implementation
- **One-on-one and group chats** - Send and receive messages in any chat type
- **Message editing and reactions** - Edit sent messages and add reactions
- **Quoting/replying** - Reply to specific messages with context
- **Delivery receipts** - Track delivery, read, and played status

### Media handling

- **Upload and download** - Support for images, videos, documents, GIFs, and audio
- **Automatic encryption** - Transparent encryption/decryption for all media

### Contacts and groups

- **Phone number validation** - Check if phone numbers are on WhatsApp
- **Profile information** - Fetch profile pictures and user info

### Presence and chat state

- **Online/offline status** - Set your presence status
- **Typing indicators** - Show composing, recording, and paused states
- **Contact management** - Block and unblock contacts

### Architecture

## Project structure

The library is organized into multiple crates for maximum flexibility:

```
whatsapp-rust/
├── src/                    # Main client library
├── wacore/                 # Platform-agnostic core (no_std compatible)
│   ├── binary/             # WhatsApp binary protocol
│   ├── libsignal/          # Signal Protocol implementation
│   └── appstate/           # App state management
├── waproto/                # Protocol Buffers definitions
├── storages/sqlite-storage # SQLite backend
├── transports/tokio-transport
└── http_clients/ureq-client
```

## Acknowledgements

This project would not be possible without the excellent work of:

- [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow) - Go implementation
- [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) - TypeScript implementation
