## Prerequisites

Before installing whatsapp-rust, ensure you have:

- **Rust 2024 edition** or later (requires recent stable Rust)
- **Cargo** package manager
- **SQLite** (if using the default storage backend)

## Add to your project

Add whatsapp-rust and its required dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

<CodeGroup>

```toml Default features
[dependencies]
whatsapp-rust = "0.2"
whatsapp-rust-sqlite-storage = "0.2"
whatsapp-rust-tokio-transport = "0.2"
whatsapp-rust-ureq-http-client = "0.2"
wacore = "0.2"
waproto = "0.2"
tokio = { version = "1.48", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

```toml Minimal setup
[dependencies]
whatsapp-rust = { version = "0.2", default-features = false }
whatsapp-rust-sqlite-storage = "0.2"
whatsapp-rust-tokio-transport = "0.2"
whatsapp-rust-ureq-http-client = "0.2"
wacore = "0.2"
waproto = "0.2"
tokio = { version = "1.48", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

</CodeGroup>

## Feature flags

whatsapp-rust supports several optional features:

| Feature | Description | Included by default |
|---------|-------------|--------------------|
| `sqlite-storage` | SQLite storage backend | ✅ Yes |
| `tokio-transport` | Tokio WebSocket transport | ✅ Yes |
| `ureq-client` | Ureq HTTP client | ✅ Yes |
| `tokio-native` | Tokio multi-threaded runtime | ✅ Yes |
| `signal` | Unix signal handling | ❌ No |
| `danger-skip-tls-verify` | Skip TLS verification (unsafe) | ❌ No |

</Note>

## Custom features example

If you want to use only specific features:

```toml Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
whatsapp-rust = { version = "0.2", default-features = false, features = ["sqlite-storage", "tokio-transport"] }
```

## Verify installation

Create a simple test file to verify the installation:

```rust src/main.rs
use whatsapp_rust::bot::Bot;

fn main() {
    println!("whatsapp-rust installed successfully!");
}
```

Run it with:

```bash
cargo run
```

If you see "whatsapp-rust installed successfully!", you're ready to move on to the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide.
